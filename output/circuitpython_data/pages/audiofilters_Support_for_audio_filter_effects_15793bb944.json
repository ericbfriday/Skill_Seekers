You can use it to emulate the sound of early digital audio devices.\n\nEmulates the warm distortion produced by a field effect transistor, which is commonly used in solid-state musical instrument amplifiers. The audiofilters.Distortion.drive property has no effect in this mode.\n\nWaveshaper distortions are used mainly by electronic musicians to achieve an extra-abrasive sound.\n\nsound according to the DistortionMode.\n\nThe mix parameter allows you to change how much of the unchanged sample passes through to the output to how much of the effect audio you hear as the output.\n\ndrive (synthio.BlockInput) – Distortion power.

(read-only)\n\nPlays the sample once when loop=False and continuously when loop=True. Does not block. Use playing to block.\n\nThe sample must match the encoding settings given in the constructor.\n\nThe effect object itself. Can be used for chaining, ie: audio.play(effect.play(sample)).\n\nStops playback of the sample.\n\ncreated by a synthio.Synthesizer object. This can be used to generate a low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter.\n\nThe mix parameter allows you to change how much of the unchanged sample passes through to the output to how much of the effect audio you hear as the output.\n\nfilter (Optional[synthio.Biquad|Tuple[synthio.Biquad]]) – A normalized biquad filter object or tuple of normalized biquad filter objects.

Can be used for chaining, ie: audio.play(effect.play(sample)).\n\nStops playback of the sample.\n\nnumber of all-pass filter stages. This slightly delays the signal so that it is out of phase with the original signal. When the amount of phase is modulated and mixed back into the original signal with the mix parameter, it creates a distinctive phasing sound.\n\nfrequency (synthio.BlockInput) – The target frequency which is affected by the effect in hz.\n\nstages (int) – The number of all-pass filters which will be applied to the signal.\n\nfeedback (synthio.BlockInput) – The amount that the previous output of the filters is mixed back into their input along with the unprocessed signal.\n\nmix (synthio.BlockInput) – The mix as a ratio of the sample (0.0) to the effect (1.0).\n\nbuffer_size (int) – The total size in bytes of each of the two playback buffers to use\n\nsample_rate (int) – The sample rate to be used\n\nchannel_count (int) – The number of channels the source samples contain. 1 = mono; 2 = stereo.\n\nbits_per_sample (int) – The bits per sample of the effect\n\nsamples_signed (bool) – Effect is signed (True) or unsigned (False)\n\nPlaying adding a phaser to a synth:\n\nDeinitialises the Phaser.\n\nNo-op used by Context Managers.\n\nAutomatically deinitializes when exiting a context. See Lifetime and ContextManagers for more info.\n\nThe target frequency in hertz at which the phaser is delaying the signal.\n\nThe amount of which the incoming signal is fed back into the phasing filters from 0.1 to 0.9.\n\nThe amount that the effect signal is mixed into the output between 0 and 1 where 0 is only the original sample and 1 is all effect.\n\nThe number of allpass filters to pass the signal through. More stages requires more processing but produces a more pronounced effect. Requires a minimum value of 1.\n\nTrue when the effect is playing a sample.
