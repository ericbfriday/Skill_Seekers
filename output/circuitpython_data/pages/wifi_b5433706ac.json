The counter resets after each poll.\n\nReturns the packet queued count.\n\nReturns the monitor packet.\n\nA wifi network provided by a nearby access point.\n\nYou cannot create an instance of wifi.Network. They are returned by wifi.Radio.start_scanning_networks.\n\nString id of the network\n\nBSSID of the network (usually the AP’s MAC address)\n\nSignal strength of the network\n\nChannel number the network is operating on\n\nString id of the country code\n\nList of authmodes (wifi.AuthMode) used by the network\n\nThe packet parameters.\n\nThe packet’s channel.\n\nThe packet’s payload.\n\nPower-saving options for wifi\n\nOn boards using the CYW43 radio module, the choices below correspond to the power management values defined in the cyw43 module: PowerManagement.MIN is the same as cyw43.PM_PERFORMANCE, PowerManagement.MAX is the same as cyw43.PM_AGGRESSIVE, and PowerManagement.NONE is the same as cyw43.PM_DISABLED. If a custom value was set with cyw43.set_power_management() not corresponding to one of these three values, then PowerManagement.UNKNOWN will be returned.\n\nMinimum power management (default). The WiFi station wakes up to receive a beacon every DTIM period. The DTIM period is set by the access point.\n\nMaximum power management, at the expense of some performance. The WiFi station wakes up less often than MIN.\n\nNo power management: the WiFi station does not sleep.\n\nPower management setting cannot be determined.\n\nThis class manages the station and access point functionality of the native Wifi radio.\n\nYou cannot create an instance of wifi.Radio. Use wifi.radio to access the sole instance available.\n\nTrue when the wifi radio is enabled. If you set the value to False, any open sockets will be closed.\n\nHostname for wifi interface. When the hostname is altered after interface started/connected the changes would only be reflected once the interface restarts/reconnects.\n\nthe changes would only be reflected once the interface reconnects.\n\nLimitations: Not settable on RP2040 CYW43 boards, such as Pi Pico W.\n\nWifi transmission power, in dBm.\n\nWifi power management setting. See wifi.PowerManagement. The default is wifi.PowerManagement.MIN.\n\nthe changes would only be reflected once the interface restarts.\n\nLimitations: Not settable on RP2040 CYW43 boards, such as Pi Pico W.\n\nScans for available wifi networks over the given channel range. Make sure the channels are allowed in your country.\n\nIn the raspberrypi port (RP2040 CYW43), start_channel and stop_channel are ignored.\n\nStop scanning for Wifi networks and free any resources used to do it.\n\nStarts running an access point with the specified ssid and password.\n\nIf channel is given, the access point will use that channel unless a station is already operating on a different channel.\n\nIf authmode is not None, the access point will use the given authentication modes. If a non-empty password is given, authmode must not include OPEN. If authmode is not given or is an empty iterable, (wifi.AuthMode.OPEN,) will be used when the password is the empty string, otherwise authmode will be (wifi.AuthMode.WPA, wifi.AuthMode.WPA2, wifi.AuthMode.PSK).\n\nLimitations: On Espressif, authmode with a non-empty password must include wifi.AuthMode.PSK, and one or both of wifi.AuthMode.WPA and wifi.AuthMode.WPA2. On Pi Pico W, authmode is ignored; it is always (wifi.AuthMode.WPA2, wifi.AuthMode.PSK) with a non-empty password, or (wifi.AuthMode.OPEN), when no password is given. On Pi Pico W, the AP can be started and stopped only once per reboot.\n\nThe length of password must be 8-63 characters if it is ASCII, or exactly 64 hexadecimal characters if it is the hex form of the 256-bit key.\n\nIf max_connections is given, the access point will allow up to that number of stations to connect.\n\nIn the raspberrypi port (RP2040 CYW43), max_connections is ignored.\n\nStops the access point.\n\nTrue if running as an access point. (read-only)\n\nConnects to the given ssid and waits for an ip address. Reconnections are handled automatically once one connection succeeds.\n\nThe length of password must be 0 if there is no password, 8-63 characters if it is ASCII, or exactly 64 hexadecimal characters if it is the hex form of the 256-bit key.\n\nBy default, this will scan all channels and connect to the access point (AP) with the given ssid and greatest signal strength (rssi).\n\nIf channel is non-zero, the scan will begin with the given channel and connect to the first AP with the given ssid. This can speed up the connection time significantly because a full scan doesn’t occur.\n\nIf bssid is given and not None, the scan will start at the first channel or the one given and connect to the AP with the given bssid and ssid.\n\nTrue if connected to an access point (read-only).\n\nIP v4 Address of the station gateway when connected to an access point. None otherwise. (read-only)\n\nIP v4 Address of the access point gateway, when enabled. None otherwise. (read-only)\n\nIP v4 Address of the station subnet when connected to an access point. None otherwise. (read-only)\n\nIP v4 Address of the access point subnet, when enabled. None otherwise. (read-only)\n\nSets the IP v4 address of the station. Must include the netmask and gateway. DNS address is optional. Setting the address manually will stop the DHCP client.\n\nIn the raspberrypi port (RP2040 CYW43), the access point needs to be started before the IP v4 address can be set.\n\nSets the IP v4 address of the access point. Must include the netmask and gateway.\n\nAddress(es) of the station when connected to an access point. Empty sequence when not connected. (read-only)\n\nAddress(es) of the access point when enabled. Empty sequence when disabled. (read-only)\n\nIP v4 Address of the station when connected to an access point. None otherwise. (read-only)\n\nIP v4 Address of the access point, when enabled. None otherwise. (read-only)\n\nIP v4 Address of the DNS server to be used.\n\nAddress of the DNS server to be used.\n\nNetwork object containing BSSID, SSID, authmode, channel, country and RSSI when connected to an access point. None otherwise.\n\nIn AP mode, returns list of named tuples, each of which contains: mac: bytearray (read-only) rssi: int (read-only, None on Raspberry Pi Pico W) ipv4_address: ipv4_address (read-only, None if station connected but no address assigned yet or self-assigned address)\n\nStarts the station DHCP client.\n\nBy default, calling this function starts DHCP for IPv4 networks but not IPv6 networks. When the the ipv4 and ipv6 arguments are False then the corresponding DHCP client is stopped if it was active.\n\nStops the station DHCP client. Needed to assign a static IP address.\n\nStarts the access point DHCP server.\n\nStops the access point DHCP server. Needed to assign a static IP address.\n\nPing an IP to test connectivity. Returns echo time in seconds. Returns None when it times out.\n\nLimitations: On Espressif, calling ping() multiple times rapidly exhausts available resources after several calls. Rather than failing at that point, ping() will wait two seconds for enough resources to be freed up before proceeding.\n\nIterates over all wifi.Network objects found while scanning. This object is always created by a wifi.Radio: it has no user-visible constructor.\n\nCannot be instantiated directly. Use wifi.Radio.start_scanning_networks.\n\nReturns itself since it is the iterator.\n\nReturns the next wifi.Network. Raises StopIteration if scanning is finished and no other results are available.",
