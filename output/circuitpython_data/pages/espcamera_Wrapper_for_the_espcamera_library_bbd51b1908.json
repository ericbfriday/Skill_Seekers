Less resources but first fb_count frames might be old\n\nExcept when 1 frame buffer is used, queue will always contain the last fb_count frames\n\nFormat of data in the captured frames\n\nA 16-bit format with 5 bits of Red and Blue and 6 bits of Green\n\nAn 8-bit format with 8-bits of luminance\n\nThe pixel size of the captured frames\n\nThe maximum amount of gain applied to raw sensor data.\n\nHigher values are useful in darker conditions, but increase image noise.\n\nConfigure and initialize a camera with the given properties\n\nNot all supported sensors have all of the properties listed below. For instance, the OV5640 supports denoise, but the OV2640 does not. The underlying esp32-camera library does not provide a reliable API to check which settings are supported. CircuitPython makes a best effort to determine when an unsupported property is set and will raise an exception in that case.\n\ndata_pins – The 8 data data_pins used for image data transfer from the camera module, least significant bit first\n\npixel_clock_pin – The pixel clock output from the camera module\n\nvsync_pin – The vertical sync pulse output from the camera module\n\nhref_pin – The horizontal reference output from the camera module\n\ni2c – The I2C bus connected to the camera module\n\nexternal_clock_pin – The pin on which to generate the external clock\n\nexternal_clock_frequency – The frequency generated on the external clock pin\n\npowerdown_pin – The powerdown input to the camera module\n\nreset_pin – The reset input to the camera module\n\npixel_format – The pixel format of the captured image\n\nframe_size – The size of captured image\n\njpeg_quality – For PixelFormat.JPEG, the quality. Higher numbers increase quality. If the quality is too high, the JPEG data will be larger than the available buffer size and the image will be unusable or truncated. The exact range of appropriate values depends on the sensor and must be determined empirically.\n\nframebuffer_count – The number of framebuffers (1 for single-buffered and 2 for double-buffered)\n\ngrab_mode – When to grab a new frame\n\nDeinitialises the camera and releases all memory resources for reuse.\n\nNo-op used by Context Managers.\n\nAutomatically deinitializes the hardware when exiting a context. See Lifetime and ContextManagers for more info.\n\nTrue if a frame is available, False otherwise\n\nRecord a frame. Wait up to ‘timeout’ seconds for a frame to be captured.\n\nIn the case of timeout, None is returned. If pixel_format is PixelFormat.JPEG, the returned value is a read-only memoryview. Otherwise, the returned value is a read-only displayio.Bitmap.\n\nChange multiple related camera settings simultaneously\n\nBecause these settings interact in complex ways, and take longer than the other properties to set, they are set together in a single function call.\n\nIf an argument is unspecified or None, then the setting is unchanged.\n\nThe pixel format of captured frames\n\nThe size of captured frames\n\nThe sensor contrast. Positive values increase contrast, negative values lower it. The total range is device-specific but is often from -2 to +2 inclusive.\n\nThe sensor brightness. Positive values increase brightness, negative values lower it. The total range is device-specific but is often from -2 to +2 inclusive.\n\nThe sensor saturation. Positive values increase saturation (more vibrant colors), negative values lower it (more muted colors). The total range is device-specific but the value is often from -2 to +2 inclusive.\n\nThe sensor sharpness. Positive values increase sharpness (more defined edges), negative values lower it (softer edges). The total range is device-specific but the value is often from -2 to +2 inclusive.\n\nThe sensor ‘denoise’ setting. Any camera sensor has inherent ‘noise’, especially in low brightness environments. Software algorithms can decrease noise at the expense of fine detail. A larger value increases the amount of software noise removal. The total range is device-specific but the value is often from 0 to 10.\n\nThe sensor ‘gain ceiling’ setting. “Gain” is an analog multiplier applied to the raw sensor data. The ‘ceiling’ is the maximum gain value that the sensor will use. A higher gain means that the sensor has a greater response to light, but also makes sensor noise more visible.\n\nThe ‘quality’ setting when capturing JPEG images. This is similar to the quality setting when exporting a jpeg image from photo editing software. Typical values range from 5 to 40, with higher numbers leading to larger image sizes and better overall image quality. However, when the quality is set to a high number, the total size of the JPEG data can exceed the size of an internal buffer, causing image capture to fail.\n\nWhen True, a test pattern image is captured and the real sensor data is not used.\n\nWhen True, the camera attempts to automatically control white balance. When False, the wb_mode setting is used instead.\n\nWhen True, the camera attempts to automatically control the sensor gain, up to the value in the gain_ceiling property. When False, the agc_gain setting is used instead.\n\nWhen True the camera attempts to automatically control the exposure. When False, the aec_value setting is used instead.\n\nWhen True the camera image is mirrored left-to-right\n\nWhen True the camera image is flipped top-to-bottom\n\nWhen True the sensor’s “night mode” is enabled, extending the range of automatic gain control.\n\nAccess the awb_gain property of the camera sensor\n\nAccess the gain level of the sensor. Higher values produce brighter images. Typical settings range from 0 to 30.\n\nAccess the exposure value of the camera. Higher values produce brighter images. Typical settings range from 0 to 1200.\n\nEnable a “special effect”. Zero is no special effect. On OV5640, special effects range from 0 to 6 inclusive and select various color modes.\n\nThe white balance mode. 0 is automatic white balance. Typical values range from 0 to 4 inclusive.\n\nThe exposure offset for automatic exposure. Typical values range from -2 to +2.\n\nWhen True an advanced white balance mode is selected.\n\nWhen True, “black point compensation” is enabled. This can make black parts of the image darker.\n\nWhen True, “white point compensation” is enabled. This can make white parts of the image whiter.\n\nWhen True, raw gamma mode is enabled.\n\nEnable “lens correction”. This can help compensate for light fall-off at the edge of the sensor area.\n\nThe maximum frame size that can be captured\n\nThe I2C (SCCB) address of the sensor\n\nThe name of the sensor\n\nTrue if the sensor can capture images in JPEG format\n\nThe height of the image being captured\n\nThe width of the image being captured\n\nThe grab mode of the camera\n\nTrue if double buffering is used",
