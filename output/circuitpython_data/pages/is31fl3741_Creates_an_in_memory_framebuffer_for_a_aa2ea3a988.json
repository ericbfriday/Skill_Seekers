  "content": "Available on these boards Adafruit LED Glasses Driver nRF52840\n\nCreate a IS31FL3741_FrameBuffer object with the given attributes.\n\nThe framebuffer is in “RGB888” format using 4 bytes per pixel. Bits 24-31 are ignored. The format is in RGB order.\n\nIf a framebuffer is not passed in, one is allocated and initialized to all black. In any case, the framebuffer can be retrieved by passing the Is31fl3741 object to memoryview().\n\nA Is31fl3741 is often used in conjunction with a framebufferio.FramebufferDisplay.\n\nis31 (is31fl3741.IS31FL3741) – base IS31FL3741 instance to drive the framebuffer\n\nwidth (int) – width of the display\n\nheight (int) – height of the display\n\nmapping (Tuple[int, ...]) – mapping of matrix locations to LEDs\n\nframebuffer (Optional[WriteableBuffer]) – Optional buffer to hold the display\n\nscale (bool) – if True display is scaled down by 3 when displayed\n\ngamma (bool) – if True apply gamma correction to all LEDs\n\nFree the resources associated with this IS31FL3741 instance. After deinitialization, no further operations may be performed.\n\nIn the current implementation, 0.0 turns the display off entirely and any other value up to 1.0 turns the display on fully.\n\nTransmits the color data in the buffer to the pixels so that they are shown.\n\nThe width of the display, in pixels\n\nThe height of the display, in pixels\n\nDriver for an IS31FL3741 device.\n\nCreate a IS31FL3741 object with the given attributes.\n\nDesigned to work low level or passed to and object such as IS31FL3741_FrameBuffer.\n\ni2c (I2C) – I2C bus the IS31FL3741 is on\n\naddr (int) – device address\n\nFree the resources associated with this IS31FL3741 instance. After deinitialization, no further operations may be performed.\n\nResets the IS31FL3741 chip.\n\nEnables the IS31FL3741 chip.\n\nSets the global current of the IS31FL3741 chip.\n\ncurrent (int) – global current value 0x00 to 0xFF\n\nResets the IS31FL3741 chip.\n\nled (int) – which LED to set\n\nvalue (int) – value to set the LED to 0x00 to 0xFF\n\npage (int) – page to write to 0 or 2. If the LED is a >= 180 the routine will automatically write to page 1 or 3 (instead of 0 or 2)\n\nWrite buf out on the I2C bus to the IS31FL3741.\n\nmapping (~Tuple[int, ...]) – map the pixels in the buffer to the order addressed by the driver chip\n\nbuf (ReadableBuffer) – The bytes to clock out.
