For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: re.\n\nThis module implements regular expression operations. Regular expression syntax supported is a subset of CPython re module (and actually is a subset of POSIX extended regular expressions).\n\nSupported operators and special sequences are:\n\nMatch set of characters. Individual characters and ranges are supported, including negated sets (e.g. [^a-c]).\n\nMatch the start of the string.\n\nMatch the end of the string.\n\nMatch zero or one of the previous sub-pattern.\n\nMatch zero or more of the previous sub-pattern.\n\nMatch one or more of the previous sub-pattern.\n\nNon-greedy version of ?, match zero or one, with the preference for zero.\n\nNon-greedy version of *, match zero or more, with the preference for the shortest match.\n\nNon-greedy version of +, match one or more, with the preference for the shortest match.\n\nMatch either the left-hand side or the right-hand side sub-patterns of this operator.\n\nGrouping. Each group is capturing (a substring it captures can be accessed with match.group() method).\n\nMatches digit. Equivalent to [0-9].\n\nMatches non-digit. Equivalent to [^0-9].\n\nMatches whitespace. Equivalent to [ \\t-\\r].\n\nMatches non-whitespace. Equivalent to [^ \\t-\\r].\n\nMatches “word characters” (ASCII only). Equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_].\n\nMatches non “word characters” (ASCII only). Equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_].\n\nEscape character. Any other character following the backslash, except for those listed above, is taken literally. For example, \\* is equivalent to literal * (not treated as the * operator). Note that \\r, \\n, etc. are not handled specially, and will be equivalent to literal letters r, n, etc. Due to this, it’s not recommended to use raw Python strings (r\"\") for regular expressions. For example, r\"\\r\\n\" when used as the regular expression is equivalent to \"rn\". To match CR character followed by LF, use \"\\r\\n\".\n\ncounted repetitions ({m,n})\n\nnamed groups ((?P<name>...))\n\nnon-capturing groups ((?:...))\n\nmore advanced assertions (\\b, \\B)\n\nspecial character escapes like \\r, \\n - use Python’s own escaping instead\n\nCompile regular expression, return regex object.\n\nCompile regex_str and match against string. Match always happens from starting position in a string.\n\nCompile regex_str and search it in a string. Unlike match, this will search string for first position which matches regex (which still may be 0 if regex is anchored).\n\nCompile regex_str and search for it in string, replacing all matches with replace, and returning the new string.\n\nreplace can be a string or a function. If it is a string then escape sequences of the form \\<number> and \\g<number> can be used to expand to the corresponding group (or an empty string for unmatched groups). If replace is a function then it must take a single argument (the match) and should return a replacement string.\n\nIf count is specified and non-zero then substitution will stop after this many substitutions are made. The flags argument is ignored.\n\nNote: availability of this function depends on MicroPython port.\n\nFlag value, display debug information about compiled expression. (Availability depends on MicroPython port.)\n\nCompiled regular expression. Instances of this class are created using re.compile().\n\nSimilar to the module-level functions match(), search() and sub(). Using methods is (much) more efficient if the same regex is applied to multiple strings.\n\nSplit a string using regex. If max_split is given, it specifies maximum number of splits to perform. Returns list of strings (there may be up to max_split+1 elements if it’s specified).\n\nMatch objects as returned by match() and search() methods, and passed to the replacement function in sub().\n\nReturn matching (sub)string. index is 0 for entire match, 1 and above for each capturing group. Only numeric groups are supported.\n\nReturn a tuple containing all the substrings of the groups of the match.\n\nNote: availability of this method depends on MicroPython port.\n\nReturn the index in the original string of the start or end of the substring group that was matched. index defaults to the entire group, otherwise it will select a group.\n\nNote: availability of these methods depends on MicroPython port.\n\nReturns the 2-tuple (match.start(index), match.end(index)).\n\nNote: availability of this method depends on MicroPython port.",
