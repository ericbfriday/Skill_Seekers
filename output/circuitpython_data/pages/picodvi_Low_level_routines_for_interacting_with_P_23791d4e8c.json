Memory is allocated onto the heap and then moved outside on VM end.\n\nThis may change the system clock speed to match the DVI signal. Make sure to initialize other objects after this one so they account for the changed clock.\n\nThis allocates a very large framebuffer and is most likely to succeed the earlier it is attempted.\n\nOn RP2040, each dp and dn pair of pins must be neighboring, such as 19 and 20. They must also be ordered the same way. In other words, dp must be less than dn for all pairs or dp must be greater than dn for all pairs.\n\nOn RP2350, all pins must be an HSTX output but can be in any order.\n\nThe framebuffer pixel format varies depending on color_depth:\n\n1 - Each bit is a pixel. Either white (1) or black (0).\n\n2 - Each two bits is a pixel. Grayscale between white (0x3) and black (0x0).\n\n4 - Each nibble is a pixel in RGB format. The fourth bit is ignored. (RP2350 only)\n\n8 - Each byte is a pixel in RGB332 format.\n\n16 - Each two bytes is a pixel in RGB565 format.\n\n32 - Each four bytes is a pixel in RGB888 format. The top byte is ignored.\n\nOutput resolution support varies between the RP2040 and RP2350.\n\nOn RP2040, two output resolutions are currently supported, 640x480 and 800x480. Monochrome framebuffers (color_depth=1 or 2) must be full resolution. Color framebuffers must be half resolution (320x240 or 400x240) and pixels will be duplicated to create the signal.\n\nOn RP2350, output resolution is either 640x480 or 720x400. Monochrome framebuffers (color_depth=1 or 2) must be full resolution. 4-bit color must also be full resolution. 8-bit color can be quarter, half or full resolution. 16-bit color and 32-bit color must be quarter or half resolution due to internal RAM limitations.\n\nA Framebuffer is often used in conjunction with a framebufferio.FramebufferDisplay.\n\nwidth (int) – the width of the source framebuffer. Support varies with chipset.\n\nheight (int) – the height of the source framebuffer. Support varies with chipset.\n\nclk_dp (Pin) – the positive clock signal pin\n\nclk_dn (Pin) – the negative clock signal pin\n\nred_dp (Pin) – the positive red signal pin\n\nred_dn (Pin) – the negative red signal pin\n\ngreen_dp (Pin) – the positive green signal pin\n\ngreen_dn (Pin) – the negative green signal pin\n\nblue_dp (Pin) – the positive blue signal pin\n\nblue_dn (Pin) – the negative blue signal pin\n\ncolor_depth (int) – the color depth of the framebuffer in bits. 1, 2 for grayscale and 4 (RP2350 only), 8 or 16 for color, 32 for color (RP2350 only)\n\nFree the resources (pins, timers, etc.) associated with this picodvi.Framebuffer instance. After deinitialization, no further operations may be performed.\n\nThe width of the framebuffer, in pixels. It may be doubled for output.\n\nThe width of the framebuffer, in pixels. It may be doubled for output.\n\nThe color depth of the framebuffer.",
