  "content": "Though this MicroPython-based library may be available for use in some builds of CircuitPython, it is unsupported and its functionality may change in the future, perhaps significantly. As CircuitPython continues to develop, it may be changed to comply more closely with the corresponding standard Python library. You will likely need to change your code later if you rely on any non-standard functionality it currently provides.\n\nThis module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described below. For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: heapq.\n\nThis module implements the min heap queue algorithm.\n\nA heap queue is essentially a list that has its elements stored in such a way that the first item of the list is always the smallest.\n\nPush the item onto the heap.\n\nPop the first item from the heap, and return it. Raise IndexError if heap is empty.\n\nThe returned item will be the smallest item in the heap.\n\nConvert the list x into a heap. This is an in-place operation.",
