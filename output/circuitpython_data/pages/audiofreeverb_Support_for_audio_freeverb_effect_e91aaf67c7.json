The size of the room can be adjusted as well as how much the higher frequencies get absorbed by the walls.\n\nThe mix parameter allows you to change how much of the unchanged sample passes through to the output to how much of the effect audio you hear as the output.\n\nroomsize (synthio.BlockInput) – The size of the room. 0.0 = smallest; 1.0 = largest.\n\ndamp (synthio.BlockInput) – How much the walls absorb. 0.0 = least; 1.0 = most.\n\nmix (synthio.BlockInput) – The mix as a ratio of the sample (0.0) to the effect (1.0).\n\nbuffer_size (int) – The total size in bytes of each of the two playback buffers to use\n\nsample_rate (int) – The sample rate to be used\n\nchannel_count (int) – The number of channels the source samples contain. 1 = mono; 2 = stereo.\n\nbits_per_sample (int) – The bits per sample of the effect. Freeverb requires 16 bits.\n\nsamples_signed (bool) – Effect is signed (True) or unsigned (False). Freeverb requires signed (True).\n\nPlaying adding reverb to a synth:\n\nDeinitialises the Freeverb.\n\nNo-op used by Context Managers.\n\nAutomatically deinitializes when exiting a context. See Lifetime and ContextManagers for more info.\n\nApparent size of the room 0.0-1.0\n\nHow much the high frequencies are dampened in the area. 0.0-1.0\n\nThe rate the reverb mix between 0 and 1 where 0 is only sample and 1 is all effect.\n\nTrue when the effect is playing a sample. (read-only)\n\nPlays the sample once when loop=False and continuously when loop=True. Does not block. Use playing to block.\n\nThe sample must match the encoding settings given in the constructor.\n\nThe effect object itself. Can be used for chaining, ie: audio.play(effect.play(sample)).\n\nStops playback of the sample. The reverb continues playing.",
