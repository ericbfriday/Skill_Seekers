  "content": "Limitations: Not implemented on the smallest CircuitPython boards for space reasons.\n\nThis module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described below. For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: collections.\n\nThis module implements advanced collection and container types to hold/accumulate various objects.\n\nDeques (pronounced “deck” and short for “double-ended queue”) are fixed length list-like containers that support O(1) appends and pops from either side of the deque. New deques are created using the following arguments:\n\niterable must be specified as an empty or non-empty iterable. If the iterable is empty, the new deque is created empty. If the iterable is not empty, the new deque is created with the items from the iterable.\n\nmaxlen must be specified and the deque will be bounded to this maximum length. Once the deque is full, any new items added will discard items from the opposite end.\n\nflag is optional and can be set to 1 to check for overflow when adding items. If the deque is full and overflow checking is enabled, an IndexError will be raised when adding items.\n\nDeque objects have the following methods:\n\nAdd x to the right side of the deque. Raises IndexError if overflow checking is enabled and there is no more room in the queue.\n\nAdd x to the left side of the deque. Raises IndexError if overflow checking is enabled and there is no more room in the queue.\n\nRemove and return an item from the right side of the deque. Raises IndexError if no items are present.\n\nRemove and return an item from the left side of the deque. Raises IndexError if no items are present.\n\nExtend the right side of the deque by appending items from the iterable argument. Raises IndexError if overflow checking is enabled and there is no more room left for all of the items in iterable.\n\nIn addition to the above, deques support iteration, bool, len(d), reversed(d), membership testing with the in operator, and subscript references like d[0]. Note: Indexed access is O(1) at both ends but slows to O(n) in the middle of the deque, so for fast random access use a list instead.\n\nThis is factory function to create a new namedtuple type with a specific name and set of fields. A namedtuple is a subclass of tuple which allows to access its fields not just by numeric index, but also with an attribute access syntax using symbolic field names. Fields is a sequence of strings specifying field names. For compatibility with CPython it can also be a a string with space-separated field named (but this is less efficient). Example of use:\n\ndict type subclass which remembers and preserves the order of keys added. When ordered dict is iterated over, keys/items are returned in the order they were added:",
