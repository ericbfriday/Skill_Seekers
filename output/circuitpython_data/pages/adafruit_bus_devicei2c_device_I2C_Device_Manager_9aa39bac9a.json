Parameters: i2c (I2C) – The I2C bus the device is on device_address (int) – The 7 bit device address probe (bool) – Probe for the device upon object creation, default is true Example: import busio from board import * from adafruit_bus_device.i2c_device import I2CDevice with busio.I2C(SCL, SDA) as i2c: device = I2CDevice(i2c, 0x70) bytes_read = bytearray(4) with device: device.readinto(bytes_read) # A second transaction with device: device.write(bytes_read) __enter__() → I2CDevice Context manager entry to lock bus. __exit__() → None Automatically unlocks the bus on exit. readinto(buffer: circuitpython_typing.WriteableBuffer, *, start: int = 0, end: int = sys.maxsize) → None Read into buffer from the device. If start or end is provided, then the buffer will be sliced as if buffer[start:end] were passed. The number of bytes read will be the length of buffer[start:end]. Parameters: buffer (WriteableBuffer) – read bytes into this buffer start (int) – beginning of buffer slice end (int) – end of buffer slice; if not specified, use len(buffer) write(buffer: circuitpython_typing.ReadableBuffer, *, start: int = 0, end: int = sys.maxsize) → None Write the bytes from buffer to the device, then transmit a stop bit. If start or end is provided, then the buffer will be sliced as if buffer[start:end] were passed, but without copying the data. The number of bytes written will be the length of buffer[start:end]. Parameters: buffer (ReadableBuffer) – write out bytes from this buffer start (int) – beginning of buffer slice end (int) – end of buffer slice; if not specified, use len(buffer) write_then_readinto(out_buffer: circuitpython_typing.ReadableBuffer, in_buffer: circuitpython_typing.WriteableBuffer, *, out_start: int = 0, out_end: int = sys.maxsize, in_start: int = 0, in_end: int = sys.maxsize) → None Write the bytes from out_buffer to the device, then immediately reads into in_buffer from the device. If out_start or out_end is provided, then the buffer will be sliced as if out_buffer[out_start:out_end] were passed, but without copying the data.
