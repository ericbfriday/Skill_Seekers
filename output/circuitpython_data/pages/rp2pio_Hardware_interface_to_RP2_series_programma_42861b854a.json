  "content": "This module is intended to be used with the adafruit_pioasm library. For an introduction and guide to working with PIO in CircuitPython, see this Learn guide.\n\nUsing PIO inputs on Raspberry Pi RP2350 A2 stepping has some limitations due to a GPIO hardware issue that causes excessive leakage current (~120uA). A pin can read as high even when driven or pulled low, if the input signal is high impedance or if an attached pull-down resistor is too weak (has too high a value). See the warning in digitalio for more information.\n\nAvailable on these boards 0xCB Gemini 0xCB Helios 42.

These values are supported on both RP2350 and RP2040. For type-checking only, not actually defined in CircuitPython.\n\nA type representing one of the strings \"txfifo\", \"rxfifo\", or \"irq\". These values are supported on RP2350. For type-checking only, not actually defined in CircuitPython.\n\nA type representing one of the strings \"txfifo\", \"rxfifo\". These values are supported on RP2350 and RP2040. For type-checking only, not actually defined in CircuitPython.\n\nA single PIO StateMachine\n\nThe programmable I/O peripheral on the RP2 series of microcontrollers is unique. It is a collection of generic state machines that can be used for a variety of protocols. State machines may be independent or coordinated. Program memory and IRQs are shared between the state machines in a particular PIO instance. They are independent otherwise.\n\nThis class is designed to facilitate sharing of PIO resources. By default, it is assumed that the state machine is used on its own and can be placed in either PIO. State machines with the same program will be placed in the same PIO if possible.\n\nConstruct a StateMachine object on the given pins with the given program.\n\nThe following parameters are usually supplied directly:\n\nprogram (ReadableBuffer) – the program to run with the state machine\n\nfrequency (int) – the target clock frequency of the state machine. Actual may be less. Use 0 for system clock speed.\n\ninit (ReadableBuffer) – a program to run once at start up. This is run after program is started so instructions may be intermingled\n\nmay_exec (ReadableBuffer) – Instructions that may be executed via StateMachine.run calls. Some elements of the StateMachine’s configuration are inferred from the instructions used; for instance, if there is no in or push instruction, then the StateMachine is configured without a receive FIFO. In this case, passing a may_exec program containing an in instruction such as in x, a receive FIFO will be configured.\n\nfirst_out_pin (Pin) – the first pin to use with the OUT instruction\n\ninitial_out_pin_state (int) – the initial output value for out pins starting at first_out_pin\n\ninitial_out_pin_direction (int) – the initial output direction for out pins starting at first_out_pin\n\nfirst_in_pin (Pin) – the first pin to use with the IN instruction\n\npull_in_pin_up (int) – a 1-bit in this mask sets pull up on the corresponding in pin\n\npull_in_pin_down (int) – a 1-bit in this mask sets pull down on the corresponding in pin. Setting both pulls enables a “bus keep” function, i.e. a weak pull to whatever is current high/low state of GPIO.\n\nfirst_set_pin (Pin) – the first pin to use with the SET instruction\n\ninitial_set_pin_state (int) – the initial output value for set pins starting at first_set_pin\n\ninitial_set_pin_direction (int) – the initial output direction for set pins starting at first_set_pin\n\nfirst_sideset_pin (Pin) – the first pin to use with a side set\n\ninitial_sideset_pin_state (int) – the initial output value for sideset pins starting at first_sideset_pin\n\ninitial_sideset_pin_direction (int) – the initial output direction for sideset pins starting at first_sideset_pin\n\nsideset_enable (bool) – True when the top sideset bit is to enable. This should be used with the “.side_set # opt” directive\n\njmp_pin (Pin) – the pin which determines the branch taken by JMP PIN instructions\n\njmp_pin_pull (Pull) – The pull value for the jmp pin, default is no pull.\n\nexclusive_pin_use (bool) – When True, do not share any pins with other state machines. Pins are never shared with other peripherals\n\nwait_for_txstall (bool) – When True, writing data out will block until the TX FIFO and OSR are empty and an instruction is stalled waiting for more data. When False, data writes won’t wait for the OSR to empty (only the TX FIFO) so make sure you give enough time before deiniting or stopping the state machine.\n\nuser_interruptible (bool) – When True (the default), write(), readinto(), and write_readinto() can be interrupted by a ctrl-C. This is useful when developing a PIO program: if there is an error in the program that causes an infinite loop, you will be able to interrupt the loop. However, if you are writing to a device that can get into a bad state if a read or write is interrupted, you may want to set this to False after your program has been vetted.\n\noffset (int) – A specific offset in the state machine’s program memory where the program must be loaded. The default value, -1, allows the program to be loaded at any offset. This is appropriate for most programs.\n\nThe following parameters are usually set via assembler directives and passed using a **program.pio_kwargs argument but may also be specified directly:\n\nout_pin_count (int) – the count of consecutive pins to use with OUT starting at first_out_pin\n\nin_pin_count (int) – the count of consecutive pins to use with IN starting at first_in_pin\n\nset_pin_count (int) – the count of consecutive pins to use with SET starting at first_set_pin\n\nsideset_pin_count (int) – the count of consecutive pins to use with a side set starting at first_sideset_pin. Does not include sideset enable\n\nsideset_pindirs (bool) – True to indicate that the side set values should be applied to the PINDIRs and not the PINs\n\npio_version (int) – The version of the PIO peripheral required by the program. The constructor will raise an error if the actual hardware is not compatible with this program version.\n\nauto_push (bool) – When True, automatically save data from input shift register (ISR) into the rx FIFO when an IN instruction shifts more than push_threshold bits\n\npush_threshold (int) – Number of bits to shift before saving the ISR value to the RX FIFO\n\nin_shift_right (bool) – When True, data is shifted into the right side (LSB) of the ISR. It is shifted into the left (MSB) otherwise. NOTE! This impacts data alignment when the number of bytes is not a power of two (1, 2 or 4 bytes).\n\nauto_pull (bool) – When True, automatically load data from the tx FIFO into the output shift register (OSR) when an OUT instruction shifts more than pull_threshold bits\n\npull_threshold (int) – Number of bits to shift before loading a new value into the OSR from the tx FIFO\n\nout_shift_right (bool) – When True, data is shifted out the right side (LSB) of the OSR. It is shifted out the left (MSB) otherwise. NOTE! This impacts data alignment when the number of bytes is not a power of two (1, 2 or 4 bytes).\n\nwrap_target (int) – The target instruction number of automatic wrap. Defaults to the first instruction of the program.\n\nwrap (int) – The instruction after which to wrap to the wrap instruction. As a special case, -1 (the default) indicates the last instruction of the program.\n\nfifo_type (FifoType) – How the program accessess the FIFOs. PIO version 0 in the RP2040 only supports a subset of values, FifoType_piov0.\n\nmov_status_type (MovStatusType) – What condition the mov status instruction checks. PIO version 0 in the RP2040 only supports a subset of values, MovStatusType_piov0.\n\nmov_status_n (MovStatusType) – The FIFO depth or IRQ the mov status instruction checks for. For mov_status irq this includes the encoding of the next/prev selection bits.\n\nTurn off the state machine and release its resources.\n\nNo-op used by Context Managers. Provided by context manager helper.\n\nAutomatically deinitializes the hardware when exiting a context. See Lifetime and ContextManagers for more info.\n\nResets this state machine, runs any init and enables the clock.\n\nRuns all given instructions. They will likely be interleaved with in-memory instructions. Make sure this doesn’t wait for input!\n\nThis can be used to output internal state to the RX FIFO and then read with readinto.\n\nStops the state machine clock. Use restart to enable it.\n\nWrite the data contained in buffer to the state machine. If the buffer is empty, nothing happens.\n\nWrites to the FIFO will match the input buffer’s element size. For example, bytearray elements will perform 8 bit writes to the PIO FIFO. The RP2040’s memory bus will duplicate the value into the other byte positions. So, pulling more data in the PIO assembly will read the duplicated values.\n\nTo perform 16 or 32 bits writes into the FIFO use an array.array with a type code of the desired size.\n\nbuffer (ReadableBuffer) – Write out the data in this buffer\n\nstart (int) – Start of the slice of buffer to write out: buffer[start:end]\n\nend (int) – End of the slice; this index is not included. Defaults to len(buffer)\n\nswap (bool) – For 2- and 4-byte elements, swap (reverse) the byte order\n\nWrite data to the TX fifo in the background, with optional looping.\n\nFirst, if any previous once or loop buffer has not been started, this function blocks until they have been started. This means that any once or loop buffer will be written at least once. Then the once and/or loop buffers are queued. and the function returns. The once buffer (if specified) will be written just once. Finally, the loop and/or loop2 buffer (if specified) will continue being looped indefinitely. If both loop and loop2 are specified, they will alternate.\n\nWrites to the FIFO will match the input buffer’s element size. For example, bytearray elements will perform 8 bit writes to the PIO FIFO. The RP2040’s memory bus will duplicate the value into the other byte positions. So, pulling more data in the PIO assembly will read the duplicated values.\n\nTo perform 16 or 32 bits writes into the FIFO use an array.array with a type code of the desired size, or use memoryview.cast to change the interpretation of an existing buffer. To send just part of a larger buffer, slice a memoryview of it.\n\nIf a buffer is modified while it is being written out, the updated values will be used. However, because of interactions between CPU writes, DMA and the PIO FIFO are complex, it is difficult to predict the result of modifying multiple values. Instead, alternate between a pair of buffers.\n\nHaving both a once and a loop parameter is to support a special case in PWM generation where a change in duty cycle requires a special transitional buffer to be used exactly once. Most use cases will probably only use one of once or loop.\n\nHaving neither once nor loop terminates an existing background looping write after exactly a whole loop. This is in contrast to stop_background_write, which interrupts an ongoing DMA operation.\n\nonce (~Optional[circuitpython_typing.ReadableBuffer]) – Data to be written once\n\nloop (~Optional[circuitpython_typing.ReadableBuffer]) – Data to be written repeatedly\n\nloop2 (~Optional[circuitpython_typing.ReadableBuffer]) – Data to be written repeatedly\n\nswap (bool) – For 2- and 4-byte elements, swap (reverse) the byte order\n\nImmediately stop a background write, if one is in progress. Any DMA in progress is halted, but items already in the TX FIFO are not affected.\n\nReturns True if a background write is in progress\n\nReturns the number of pending buffers for background writing.\n\nIf the number is 0, then a StateMachine.background_write call will not block. Note that pending is a deprecated alias for pending_write and will be removed in a future version of CircuitPython.\n\nRead data from the RX fifo in the background, with optional looping.\n\nFirst, if any previous once or loop buffer has not been started, this function blocks until they have been started. This means that any once or loop buffer will be read at least once. Then the once and/or loop buffers are queued. and the function returns. The once buffer (if specified) will be read just once. Finally, the loop and/or loop2 buffer (if specified) will continue being read indefinitely. If both loop and loop2 are specified, they will alternate.\n\nReads from the FIFO will match the input buffer’s element size. For example, bytearray elements will perform 8 bit reads from the PIO FIFO. The RP2040’s memory bus will duplicate the value into the other byte positions. So, pulling more data in the PIO assembly will read the duplicated values.\n\nTo perform 16 or 32 bits reads from the FIFO use an array.array with a type code of the desired size, or use memoryview.cast to change the interpretation of an existing buffer. To receive just part of a larger buffer, slice a memoryview of it.\n\nMost use cases will probably only use one of once or loop.\n\nHaving neither once nor loop terminates an existing background looping read after exactly a whole loop. This is in contrast to stop_background_read, which interrupts an ongoing DMA operation.\n\nonce (~Optional[circuitpython_typing.WriteableBuffer]) – Data to be read once\n\nloop (~Optional[circuitpython_typing.WriteableBuffer]) – Data to be read repeatedly\n\nloop2 (~Optional[circuitpython_typing.WriteableBuffer]) – Data to be read repeatedly\n\nswap (bool) – For 2- and 4-byte elements, swap (reverse) the byte order\n\nImmediately stop a background read, if one is in progress. Any DMA in progress is halted, but items already in the RX FIFO are not affected.\n\nReturns True if a background read is in progress\n\nReturns the number of pending buffers for background reading.\n\nIf the number is 0, then a StateMachine.background_read call will not block.\n\nRead into buffer. If the number of bytes to read is 0, nothing happens. The buffer includes any data added to the fifo even if it was added before this was called.\n\nReads from the FIFO will match the input buffer’s element size. For example, bytearray elements will perform 8 bit reads from the PIO FIFO. The alignment within the 32 bit value depends on in_shift_right. When in_shift_right is True, the upper N bits will be read. The lower bits will be read when in_shift_right is False.\n\nTo perform 16 or 32 bits writes into the FIFO use an array.array with a type code of the desired size.\n\nbuffer (WriteableBuffer) – Read data into this buffer\n\nstart (int) – Start of the slice of buffer to read into: buffer[start:end]\n\nend (int) – End of the slice; this index is not included. Defaults to len(buffer)\n\nswap (bool) – For 2- and 4-byte elements, swap (reverse) the byte order\n\nWrite out the data in buffer_out while simultaneously reading data into buffer_in. The lengths of the slices defined by buffer_out[out_start:out_end] and buffer_in[in_start:in_end] may be different. The function will return once both are filled. If buffer slice lengths are both 0, nothing happens.\n\nData transfers to and from the FIFOs will match the corresponding buffer’s element size. See write and readinto for details.\n\nTo perform 16 or 32 bits writes into the FIFO use an array.array with a type code of the desired size.\n\nbuffer_out (ReadableBuffer) – Write out the data in this buffer\n\nbuffer_in (WriteableBuffer) – Read data into this buffer\n\nout_start (int) – Start of the slice of buffer_out to write out: buffer_out[out_start:out_end]\n\nout_end (int) – End of the slice; this index is not included. Defaults to len(buffer_out)\n\nin_start (int) – Start of the slice of buffer_in to read into: buffer_in[in_start:in_end]\n\nin_end (int) – End of the slice; this index is not included. Defaults to len(buffer_in)\n\nswap_out (bool) – For 2- and 4-byte elements, swap (reverse) the byte order for the buffer being transmitted (written)\n\nswap_in (bool) – For 2- and 4-rx elements, swap (reverse) the byte order for the buffer being received (read)\n\nClears any unread bytes in the rxfifo.\n\nClears the txstall flag.\n\nThe actual state machine frequency. This may not match the frequency requested due to internal limitations.\n\nTrue when the state machine has stalled due to a full TX FIFO since the last clear_txstall call.\n\nTrue when the state machine has stalled due to a full RX FIFO since the last clear_rxfifo call.\n\nThe number of words available to readinto\n\nThe instruction offset where the program was actually loaded\n\nThe current program counter of the state machine\n\nAccess the state machine’s rxfifo directly\n\nIf the state machine’s fifo mode is txput then accessing this object reads values stored by the mov rxfifo[], isr PIO instruction, and the result of modifying it is undefined.\n\nIf the state machine’s fifo mode is txget then modifying this object writes values accessed by the mov osr, rxfifo[] PIO instruction, and the result of accessing it is undefined.\n\nIf this state machine’s mode is something else, then the property’s value is None.\n\nNote: Since the txput and txget fifo mode does not exist on RP2040, this property will always be None.\n\nReturns the buffer most recently filled by background reads.\n\nThis property is self-clearing – once read, subsequent reads will return a zero-length buffer until the background read buffer changes or restarts.\n\nReturns the buffer most recently emptied by background writes.\n\nThis property is self-clearing – once read, subsequent reads will return a zero-length buffer until the background write buffer changes or restarts.",
