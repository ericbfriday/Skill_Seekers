See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.\n\nRaised when a USB transfer times out.\n\nInitialize self. See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.\n\nFind the first device that matches the given requirements or, if find_all is True, return a generator of all matching devices.\n\nReturns None if no device matches.\n\nUser code cannot create Device objects. Instead, get them from usb.core.find.\n\nCloses any resources used for this device.\n\nThe USB vendor ID of the device\n\nThe USB product ID of the device\n\nThe USB device’s serial number string.\n\nThe USB device’s product string.\n\nThe USB device’s manufacturer string.\n\nThe bus number of the root hub this device is connected to.\n\nThe port topology of the devices location. None when connected to the root port (aka bus).\n\nThe speed of the device. One of usb.util.SPEED_LOW, usb.util.SPEED_FULL, usb.util.SPEED_HIGH or 0 for unknown.\n\nSet the active configuration.\n\nThe configuration parameter is the bConfigurationValue field of the configuration you want to set as active. If you call this method without parameter, it will use the first configuration found. As a device hardly ever has more than one configuration, calling the method without arguments is enough to get the device ready.\n\nWrite data to a specific endpoint on the device.\n\nendpoint (int) – the bEndpointAddress you want to communicate with.\n\ndata (ReadableBuffer) – the data to send\n\ntimeout (int) – Time to wait specified in milliseconds. (Different from most CircuitPython!)\n\nthe number of bytes written\n\nRead data from the endpoint.\n\nendpoint (int) – the bEndpointAddress you want to communicate with.\n\nsize_or_buffer (array.array) – the array to read data into. PyUSB also allows size but CircuitPython only support array to force deliberate memory use.\n\ntimeout (int) – Time to wait specified in milliseconds. (Different from most CircuitPython!)\n\nthe number of bytes read\n\nDo a control transfer on the endpoint 0. The parameters bmRequestType, bRequest, wValue and wIndex are the same of the USB Standard Control Request format.\n\nControl requests may or may not have a data payload to write/read. In cases which it has, the direction bit of the bmRequestType field is used to infer the desired request direction.\n\nFor host to device requests (OUT), data_or_wLength parameter is the data payload to send, and it must be a sequence type convertible to an array object. In this case, the return value is the number of bytes written in the data payload.\n\nFor device to host requests (IN), data_or_wLength is an array object which the data will be read to, and the return value is the number of bytes read.\n\nDetermine if CircuitPython is using the interface. If it is, the object will be unable to perform I/O.\n\ninterface (int) – the device interface number to check\n\nStop CircuitPython from using the interface. If successful, you will then be able to perform I/O. CircuitPython will automatically re-start using the interface on reload.\n\ninterface (int) – the device interface number to stop CircuitPython on\n\nAllow CircuitPython to use the interface if it wants to.\n\ninterface (int) – the device interface number to allow CircuitPython to use",
