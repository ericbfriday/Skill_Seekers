  "content": "This module implements a subset of the corresponding CPython module, as described below. For more information, refer to the original CPython documentation: gc.\n\nEnable automatic garbage collection.\n\nDisable automatic garbage collection. Heap memory can still be allocated, and garbage collection can still be initiated manually using gc.collect().\n\nRun a garbage collection.\n\nReturn the number of bytes of heap RAM that are allocated by Python code.\n\nDifference to CPython\n\nThis function is a MicroPython extension.\n\nReturn the number of bytes of heap RAM that is available for Python code to allocate, or -1 if this amount is not known.\n\nDifference to CPython\n\nThis function is a MicroPython extension.\n\nSet or query the additional GC allocation threshold. Normally, a collection is triggered only when a new allocation cannot be satisfied, i.e. on an out-of-memory (OOM) condition. If this function is called, in addition to OOM, a collection will be triggered each time after amount bytes have been allocated (in total, since the previous time such an amount of bytes have been allocated). amount is usually specified as less than the full heap size, with the intention to trigger a collection earlier than when the heap becomes exhausted, and in the hope that an early collection will prevent excessive memory fragmentation. This is a heuristic measure, the effect of which will vary from application to application, as well as the optimal value of the amount parameter.\n\nCalling the function without argument will return the current value of the threshold. A value of -1 means a disabled allocation threshold.\n\nDifference to CPython\n\nThis function is a MicroPython extension. CPython has a similar function - set_threshold(), but due to different GC implementations, its signature and semantics are different.",
