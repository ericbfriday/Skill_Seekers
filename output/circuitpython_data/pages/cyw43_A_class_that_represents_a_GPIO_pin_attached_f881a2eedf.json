A CywPin can be used as a DigitalInOut, but not with other peripherals such as PWMOut.\n\nThe default power management mode; same as PM_PERFORMANCE\n\nAggressive power management mode for optimal power usage at the cost of performance\n\nPerformance power management mode where more power is used to increase performance\n\nDisable power management and always use highest power mode.\n\nSet the power management register\n\nFor transmitter power, see wifi.Radio.txpower. This controls software power saving features inside the cyw43 chip. it does not control transmitter power.\n\nThe value is interpreted as a 24-bit hexadecimal number of the form 0x00adbrrm.\n\n1: aggressive power saving which reduces wifi throughput\n\n2: Power saving with high throughput\n\nThe next 8 bits, r, specify “the maximum time to wait before going back to sleep” for power management mode 2. The units of r are 10ms.\n\nThe next 4 bits, b, are the “wake period is measured in beacon periods”.\n\nThe next 4 bits, d, specify the “wake interval measured in DTIMs. If this is set to 0, the wake interval is measured in beacon periods”.\n\nThe top 4 bits, a, specifies the “wake interval sent to the access point”\n\nSeveral PM_ constants gathered from various sources are included in this module. According to Raspberry Pi documentation, the value 0xa11140 (called cyw43.PM_DISABLED here) increases responsiveness at the cost of higher power usage.\n\nRetrieve the power management register",
